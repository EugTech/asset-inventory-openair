# API KEYS
Right now there is only AirTable. 

## Airtable
Got to [Airtable Account Page](https://airtable.com/account) and get yoru api key value. 

Create a new file `airtable_apikey.txt` in the `DATA/SECRET` folder and put your API 
key you get from airtable in it. 

*No spaces or extra characters*. Just the actual api value in the file.


## Google 
When we are ready for GPS, use Google API and their keys the same way as Airtable. :-)
