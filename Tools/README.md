# SaveAllData
Use this tool to save all the records from the airtable space 
into json files in the DATA folder. Each "view" will get their
own file name and json stuffed into it. 

*MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CREATED A `DATA` FOLDER!*

    cd Tools
    ./SaveTallData.js

If you are running Windows then do this....

    cd Tools
    node SaveTallData.js


# Debugging Tools
Visual Studio Code is a great tool to use to debug nodejs but you can 
use whatever debugger you want. Create the runners you need in your 
own tool to get you to a point you can step through and edit as needed.
